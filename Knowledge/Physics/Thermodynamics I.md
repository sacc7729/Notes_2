# Approximations

In thermodynamics we assume we are working with "ideal gases".  Most real gasses can be approximated by real gasses so the equations are still useful although they are inexact.

If we had an ideal point mass we could describe it with 6 variables: 3 variables for position and 3 for velocity.  However it is unrealistic to know at least 6N variables for a group of N particles.  Instead we assume that we have a perfect gas that obeys
$$
pV=nRT
$$

# Laws

We have various thermodynamic laws.  For the first law we assume that energy is being conserved (which is true).  We assume that energy is only transferred by work or heat, ignoring energy transfer through electromagnetic of chemical means.  The first law says that the energy lost by the system is equal to the amount of work done externally plus the heat transferred externally

$$
\Delta U + L = Q
$$

The second law states that energy flows from higher temperatures to lower temperatures.  This isn't so much a law as a high statistical likelihood.  We can introduce the idea of Entropy, $S$, as a measure of randomness.  In statistically mechanics we can show that there are more random states than ordered states therefore it is more likely that the system is in random states.  As an example it is more likely that molecules are distributed evenly then they all happen to be in one half of a container.

There is also a zeroth law that says Thermal equilibrium is transitive.  For example if A is in thermal equilibrium with B and B is in thermal equilibrium with C, then A and C are in thermal equilibrium.

# Helpful Formulas

Work is force times distance which is typically
$$
L = \int p dV
$$
Specific heat is the heat needed to change the temperature by one degree for some unit mass (ignoring phase changes)
$$
C_v = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T}
$$
Sometimes it is useful to work in enthalpy
$$
H = U + pV
$$
