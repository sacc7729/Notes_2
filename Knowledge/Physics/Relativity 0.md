Special Relativity 

Since objects move in straight lines and since the speed of light is constant for all observers, then we have [ref Special Relativity by Tong]
$$x_u = \Lambda^u_v x^v$$ where $\Lambda$ is a boost.

It can be shown that a boost leaves $\Delta s^2$  invariant where
$$\Delta s^2 = -t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2$$
One is either moving through space or time.
