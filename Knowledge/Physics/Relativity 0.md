Special Relativity 

Since objects move in straight lines and since the speed of light is constant for all observers, then we have [ref Special Relativity by Tong]
$$x_u = \Lambda^u_v x^v$$ where $\Lambda$ is a boost.

$$
\Lambda_{boost} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma & - \gamma * \frac{v}{c} & 0 & 0 \\
- \gamma * \frac{v}{c} & \gamma & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$.

It can be shown that a boost leaves $\Delta s^2$  invariant where
$$\Delta s^2 = -t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2$$
One is either moving through space or time.

The four momentum squared is also invariant.  Four momentum is:
$$
P =
\begin{pmatrix}
mc \gamma \\
m \gamma \textbf{u}
\end{pmatrix} 
=
\begin{pmatrix}
Energy \\
Momentum
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Spacetime diagram: $S'$ frame x and t move to null line from view of $S$.  Causality only makes sense in the light cone [David Tong].... (reconcile this with work from Carroll problem set).

Questions:
* Can clocks be synced throughout all of space with stationary observers (with no gravity)
* Some examples of distance metric ($s^2$) between events
