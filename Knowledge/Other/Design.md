teapot book with others

affordance - hints on how something works due to it's characteristic
signifiers - affordance with text
constraints - characteristics that prevent some action
mapping - relationship between two different systems (e.g. altimeter and altitude)

Make the desired case easy and the unwanted case hard.  Some tips
* Give feedback with small delays
* Enforce constraints
* Add signifiers
* Don't break on human errors (people make mistakes)
