A stock is a quantity of information or materials

Stocks change through flows.

Feedbacks loops can cause flows to change based on the amount of stock.  A stabilizing feedback look will increase stock producing flows when stocks are low.

The information delivered by a feedback loop can only affect future behavior since the information delivered by the feedback loop takes time to be delivered.

Questions to ask a system modeler:
* What if we do x?

Different types of feedback loops:
* Balancing
* Reinforcing

Delay is the time between when a signal is received and the feedback loop acts on the system.  Delays can lead to oscillations (e.g. overcompensating before effects are felt).

## System Attributes

Resilience - The ability of a system to recover
Self Organization - The ability of a (sub)system to make its structure more complex
Heirarchy - Levels of layers
Suboptimization - The ability of a subsystem to dominate at the expense of the system

## Understanding
* Event Level - What Happened
* Behavior Level - Why it Happened

System structure is the source of system behavior.

Limiting Factor - bottleneck
Bounded Rationality - Not having perfect knowledge of the entire system

## Improving systems

Some common improvements:

* A system should have it's goals aligned with the subsystems
	* Avoid suboptimization
* Systems should be able to shoulder their own burdens
	* Don't promote intervenors/heroes.  The system becomes reliant on it.
* Find Leverage Point - points that affects the entire system
	* Usually the limiting factor
* Reduce delays
* Introduce feedback loops
* Provide missing information flows
* Promote self organization
* Change paradigms (e.g. culture)

## Examples of systems

* A thermostat and outside temperature
* Economic incentives and Money
* Populations of two competing species
