A metric space consists of a space (X), distance function (d) (TODO) pair such that:

1. d(x,y) $\geq$ 0
2. d(x,y) = 0 iff x=y
3. d(x,y) = d(y,x)
4. d(x,z) $\leq$ d(x,y) + d(y,z)


A function $f:S \rightarrow R$, is "bounded"  if $|f(k)| \leq K, x \in S$.

A function is "continuous" if $|f(x) - f(a)| \leq \epsilon$ whenever $|x-a| \leq \delta$.

The open ball about A $B(a;\delta)$ is the set of all points $x \in X$ such that $d(a,x) < \delta$.

A subset of a metric space is an open set if it is a union of open balls.

A subset of a metric space is closed if it's complement is open.


TODO:

A topological space is ....
Connected if each of it's open covers has a finite subcover.  Also connected if all the clopen sets are trivial.
Compact if a union of two (maybe finite) disjoint open sets.
