A contravarient vectors transform to the opposite of a change in basis.  E.g. if the basis is halved than the contravariant vector will double.  These are usually just called vectors.

The metric space for contravariant vectors is

$$(V, S, *, +)$$

A covariant vector transform the same way as the change in basis.  These are usually called Covectors.

The metric space for covectors is

$$(V^*, S, *, +)$$
where V* is a mapping from V to a scalar.

----------------

The $ith$ component of vectors are typically written as $v^i$ .
The $ith$ component of covectors are written as $c_j$.

TODO: un mix this up, I think covectors are rows

Instead of writing vector multiplication as $$
\begin{bmatrix}
c_1, c_2, c_3
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3
\end{bmatrix}$$
We can write it as a sum.   In einstein notation we drop the summation sign.a

$$y = \sum_\limits{i=1}^3 c_iv^j
= c_1v^1 + c_2v^2 + c_3v^3 =
c_iv^j$$

A covector kind of sets the direction of a topographical map.
