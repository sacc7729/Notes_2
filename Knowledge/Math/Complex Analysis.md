Complex functions that are differentiables at every point of an open subset of the complet plane are **holomorphic**.

Holomorphic functions are infinitily differentiable and analytic.

A **conformal map** is a function that locally preserves angles (but not necessarily lengths).

A transformation is conformal whenever the Jacobian at each point is a positive scalar times the rotation matrix.

The derivative of a complex function is
$$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h}$$

For a real derivative we require the limit to be the same from above and below (two values) for complex values we require it from all different complex directions (the complex plane).

If $f$ maps the reals to the complex plane, we can integration $f$ by integrating the real parts and the complex parts.

TODO(contour integral).

If $f: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ where $f$ is a holomorphic function, $\Omega$ is open and $\mathbb{C}$ is connected then by the Cauchy-Goursat theorem

$$\oint f(z)dz = 0$$

Values of $f$ inside a disk are only determined by the boundary (by Cauchy's integral theorem).
