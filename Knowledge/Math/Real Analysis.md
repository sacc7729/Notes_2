A function $f$ is differentiable if:

$$$\lim_{t \rightarrow x} \frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t-x} = L$$
The derivative is
$$\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

A function is analytic if it is locally given by a covergent power series (i.e. it's taylor series about $x_0$ converges to the function in some neighborhood of $x_0$ for every $x_0$).

$$f(x+h) = \sum c_k h^k$$

A transformation in linear algebra is
$$T(v) = \sum_i \sum_j a_{ij} v_j e_i$$
where $e_i$ is the basis.
