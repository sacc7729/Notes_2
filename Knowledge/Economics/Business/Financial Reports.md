# Connections

Some useful assumptions from connections between the financial reports:

$\frac{balance\_sheet.accounts\_payable}{income\_statement.revenue} = \text{period of uncollected revenue per year}$

$\frac{balance\_sheet.accounts\_payable}{income\_statement.revenue} = \text{aversage sales credit period per year}$

$\frac{balance\_sheet.inventory}{cost\_of\_goods\_sold\_expense} = \text{average inventory holding period per year}$

$\frac{1 - cost\_of\_goods\_sold\_expense}{income\_statement.revenue} = \text{gross margin}$
