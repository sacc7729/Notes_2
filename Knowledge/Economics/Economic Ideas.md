### Adam Smith

* Wealth should be measured from the viewpoint of the consumer.
* Businesses plot against the consumer to help their business
* Competitions prevents businesses from charging too much
	* price point is determined because businesses will charge as much as possible
* Division of labor is good
	* Specialization is efficient
		* Can focus on a single task
		* Can create tools that make a single task more efficient
	* However may lead to divergence in wages
	* No time wasted in switching tasks
	* However can keep workers stuck in rote jobs

### Hayek

* Decentralized market is good because information
	* Can't perfectly be stored by one group
	* Needs to be acted on quickly
* You need to have market signals (e.g. prices) that reflect the actual cost folks would pay

### David Ricardo

* Absolute Advantage - Producing something more efficiently than consumers (when accounting for opportunity cost)
* Economic Rent - Payment that is not used to keep land, labor, or capital in particular use
	* Encouraged property tax to prevent economic rent

### John Stuart Mill

* Utilitarianism
* Low Income Tax but high inheritance tax
	* Equality of Opportunity

### Karl Marx

* History is full of two classes
	* Ruling Class 
	* Ruled Class 
* Ruling Class tricks ruled class into working for them (exploitation)
	* E.g. ruled class should be happy just to have a job
*  Ruling class extracts profits from the ruled class
	* If employee works 1 hour and creates $15 in earning while getting paid $10, ruling class has extracted $5 of surplus value
		* Ratio of Exploitation is 1:2
	* Ruling class can extract profits since there is a reserve army
		* reserve army - folks who would take the job instead
* Revolutions change who the ruling class is but not the fact that there is a ruling class
* Capitalism is good since it improves workers lives, but it will fail due to
	* Falling profit rates
	* Increasing concentration of economic power
	* Deepening Depressions
	* Diminishing quality of life
* After Capitalism should come system where
	* Folks want to create and will have the creative agency to do so

Communist Manifesto:
* Abolition of property
* Heavy progressive tasks
* Abolishment of inheritance
* State centralization
	* Credit
	* Transportation
* Abolition of town and country
	* Combine agriculture with industry
* Free education for all citizens
* Equal obligation for all to work


### Alfred Marshal

* Marginal utility - The next dollar should be spent on the item which will bring the greatest return
* Large companies are (originally) more efficient
	* Eventually large companies are made inefficient due to new ineffective management that increases their own influence at the expense of the companies
	* Lean and hungry eventually overtake large companies
* Technology makes workers more efficient
* Supply and Demand curves
* Elasticity in price (due to marginal utility)

### Keynes
* The private economy may not reach full employment
* Government spending can spur the economy
* The idea of government help can spur the economy
	* Folks are more likely to invest then save when they know they have a safety net
* Keynesian multiplier - Any change in spending by one person starts a snowball effect
	* If investment is $100 dollars in a project but causes $300 rise in income (of those that pass on the $100), then the Keynesian Multiplier is 3
* You can make money in the stock market by finding what other people will want to buy (not what will do well as a business)

Keynesian economics assumes employment is tied with high inflation.  And unemployment is tied with low inflation.  It does not describe stagflation and was made in the time of the gold standard.

### Milton Friedman

* Government is bad at spending
	* Consumption levels are stable and government funding doesn't change rate of consumption
	* Government spending crowds out private spending
	* Individuals should be free to choose what they want to put their money into
	* The government can spend more (causes inflation) and things can be harder to produce (results in unemployment) which results in stagflation 
		* Oil crisis of 1970s
* Money supply matters more than Keynesian flows of wealth
	* Money supply should be the amount to buy all the goods produced with full employment and no inflation
		* Dependent on velocity - speed at which money flows
			* Monetarists (e.g. Milton Friedman) see velocity as stable
		* The amount of goods that can be produced is fixed, any more money in the system leads to inflation
	* Money supply controlled by monetary policy

$\text{ Money Supply } \times \text{ Velocity} = \text {GDP} = \text{ price } \times \text{ quantity of goods produced }$

Monetarists assume velocity and quantity of goods produced is fixed.
### Others

#### Veblen
* Engineers are better at producing than management

#### Galbraith
* Firms install wants (advertise) which is market manipulation

#### Joan Robinson
* Imperfect competition - products that fall into the same category but fall into different markets (e.g. Starbucks and Folgers)

#### Judge Learned Hand
* Company should be held negligent if: $Probability \times Loss > Cost$ 
	* If there's a 10% chance an employee would be injured for $100 then a company would be negligent if it did not invest in a solution that costs $9 to prevent the injury

#### Ronald Coarse
* When a judge assigns a right for party A, party B may bribe party A not to enforce it's right

#### Gary Becker
*  Federal and State government should focus on the demand side of illegal goods since consumers may be more sensitive to join time 
 
####  George Stigler
* Businesses want regulation to prevent competition
	* regulatory capture
